Dictionary


I have created a Bat file which will help the user to directly open the dictionary on CMD 

You can access the Bat file inside Maven_project >>  SRC/main/java folder 

once user types the desired word for example : WORKING 

It will show WORK, KING, ROW , RING without duplicating it.


You can also check the other way by downloading all the files and checking the code on your editor and then running it.
